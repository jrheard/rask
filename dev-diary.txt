ok!!!

TODO how do cargo workspaces work?

TODO where should i start?
    i'm thinking web api and postgres setup, i can test it manually w that http query vscode extension i saw in that one talk
        but i think i want to set up docker as part of that!!
        so i'll need to set up, like, images??
        augh i wish i still had that diamol book but it's downstairs

well, let's start with the web api bin crate
i can split out shared logic into a lib crate later

DONE pick a web framework
DONE hello world endpoint
TODO pick a sql library
TODO set up postgres in a docker container, publish the port to my local machine
    TODO set up a docker-compose.yaml
    TODO figure out persistent storage via a volume??

i can save dockerizing the webapp for later i think!

looks like you can have multiple binaries in the same workspace, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36604010/how-can-i-build-multiple-binaries-with-cargo, cool
hm or maybe i would just use `cargo build --bin foo`
anyway neat

tbh i don't fully understand the utility of cargo workspaces
but i'll figure it out
and if i decide i don't actually want that here, i can always split em up
i think that having all my bins have access to the same lib will be useful though
and it'll be nice to not have to publish the lib via crates.io or similar each time it gets new code

ok, let's pick a web framework
https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-07-04-choosing-a-rust-web-framework-2020-edition/
actix-web is like flask, rocket is like django

i think i will go with rocket

coolcool, rocket is set up

i'm reading the docs now, https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/introduction/

i'll look into sql libraries and postgres docker stuff next
