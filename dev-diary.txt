ok!!!

TODO how do cargo workspaces work?

TODO where should i start?
    i'm thinking web api and postgres setup, i can test it manually w that http query vscode extension i saw in that one talk
        but i think i want to set up docker as part of that!!
        so i'll need to set up, like, images??
        augh i wish i still had that diamol book but it's downstairs

well, let's start with the web api bin crate
i can split out shared logic into a lib crate later

TODO pick a web framework
TODO hello world json endpoint
TODO pick a sql library
TODO set up postgres in a docker container, publish the port to my local machine
    TODO figure out persistent storage via a volume??

i can save dockerizing the webapp for later i think!

looks like you can have multiple binaries in the same workspace, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36604010/how-can-i-build-multiple-binaries-with-cargo, cool
